# Deep Learning Second Practical

This is the repository for our second deep learning
practical.

## Ensure you can run this project

Install the required packages via `pip`. The `requirements.txt`
file lists all packages in use for this project.

## Run this project

By running `main.py`, you will run a series of models in
sequence. All data get stored to two output directories:
`agent` and `results`. The former contains serialised agents,
while the latter stores deterioration levels of dykes
(starting with `det-`) and reward values of agents (`rew-`).
Check `results/ids-...` to see which ID belongs to which
specific environment-agent pair.
